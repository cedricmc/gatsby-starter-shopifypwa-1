# gatsby-starter-shopifypwa

## Shopify PWA powered by Gatsby

This will be a POC Shopify PWA using the Storefront API & GatsbyJS.

## High Level Project Goals

### Speed

Should be as fast but ideally, faster than a normal Shopify experience - especially for slower connection due to service worker.

### Highly Customizable Theme and Settings

There should be a number of ways to customize the theme without touching the code such as colors, typography, and settings (show breadcrumbs?, etc.)

### Accessible

Out-of-box, the site should be WCAG 2.0 accessible. This means aria tags where needed, AA color contrast, and keyboard accessible navigation with focus styling. This includes things like the gallery.

### Code Complete with regular Shopify themes

Should strive to offer the same features as a normal Shopify theme such as easy homepage section content, all the normal content types. See [this list of issues](https://github.com/gil--/gatsby-starter-shopifypwa/issues/4) which might prevent code complete.
